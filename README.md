# GaÃ«tan PASQUION - Portfolio & Competency Dossier

This repository hosts my portfolio and competency dossier, showcasing my experience as a developer working with technologies such as PHP (Symfony), JavaScript (React.js / Node.js), and Go.

This simple project is built as a modern React application using:
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **TailwindCSS** for styling

The portfolio presents my professional journey, key projects, and technical skills through a responsive and interactive user interface. Markdown files are used to dynamically load and present my competency dossier.

For additional inspiration on developer portfolios, please see this list: [Developer Portfolios Inspiration](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios?tab=readme-ov-file).
